% This document is all about how to format text.

This is \textbf{bold text}. % I wish there were a "textgf" command as well.

This is \emph{emphasized text} which is pretty much identical to \textit{italicized text}.

This is in \textsc{small caps}.

This is \underline{underlined}.

This is the \texttt{typewriter style} which is handy for code.

Important!  Single quotes use separate `open quote' and `closed quote' characters. % The "open quote" character is at the top of the keyboard next to the "1" key. 

Similarly for ``double quotes."  Weird, right?

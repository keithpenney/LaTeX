Hello world!
Well hi again.  Words are perfect.

Here is a simple equation: $3x_i^{5+1}+2=7$

Here's a harder equation:
$$x^2+y^2 + z^2 = 11$$
This text is offset to the left.  Wtf?

This equation has three variables.

If $a$, $b$, and $c$ are sides of a right triangle, with $c$ being the hypotenuse,
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
